## A few course policies in brief

* If you are registered for another UCSB course that overlaps with this one, you are responsible for any work or material you may miss. I am within my rights to not give credit on any work you miss as a result, and WILL NOT make accomodations.
* Collaboration is only permitted when specifically allowed for — otherwise, you must do your own work.
* I recognize that some absences (e.g. minor illnesses, mishaps, etc.) are unavoidable. Litigating whether each of these is "excused" or not isn't a good use of anyone's time, so instead we will drop the lowest two grades from everyone's homework, and drop the lowest quiz. This way, absences (or failure to submit homework) does not unduly penalize your grade unless it becomes excessive.
* We will use the [gradescope system](https://gradescope.com) this quarter for lab submissions, homework assignments, and quizzes. The final exam will be conducted in-person during the final exam block scheduled for this course. More instructions on gradescope will be given in lecture and lab assignments.
* All regrade requests must be made on Gradescope and we will not consider a regrade request one week after the assignment grades are distributed back to students.

## What this course is about 

CS 9 serves as a continuation of material covered in CS 8: Introduction to Computer Science using the Python programming language. The target of this class is for non CS majors who will learn additional fundamental CS topics such as object oriented programming, algorithm runtime analysis, fundamental data structures, and testing methodologies. By the end of this course, students will understand tradeoffs between various data structures, their performance, and their implementation. 

Learning the details of programming requires <strong>A LOT OF PRACTICE</strong>, like learning any new skill. Making mistakes is an essential part of learning as long as you learn from them! Questions like "I wonder what will happen if I do this..." or "How will Python behave in this case..." is a great way to investigate and observe the functionality and limitations of a programming language (there are many programming languages available to software developers and each have their specific pros and cons that may or may not be the best choice for the problems you are trying to solve).

I find the best way to practice is to <strong>rapid prototype</strong> constantly. Writing simple snippets of code to test and confirm your understanding allows you to 1) practice typing out code, which makes you more comfortable with the language and 2) solidify your understanding of the specific behavior of the programming language functionality.

# Course Grades

Letter grades will be determined by the end of the course after all labs, homeworks, quizzes, and final exam have been computed. I can say that I will not grade harder than a traditional straight scale (90% = A-, 80% = B-, etc.). However, I will adjust the letter grades accordingly based on your overall performance at the end of the course. If you are concerned about your grade in the class, I encourage you to discuss the matter with me during my office hours. Please come talk to me sooner rather than later so there can be some time where we can help you succeed in the course.

Your course grade will be determined as follows:

| Grade Item                        | Percentage of Final Grade |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Quizzes                           | 35 %                      |
| Final (Wed 12/8), 7:30pm - 9:30pm)| 25 %                      |
| Homeworks                         | 10 %                      |
| Labs                              | 30 %                      |

In general, homeworks will be assigned periodically throughout the quarter and should be completed on Gradescope by the due date.

There will be labs assigned throughout the quarter. Lab sections are available to ask questions and seek assistance. Please be sure to check the due dates for all assignments on the course page and calendar.

# Late work

I will consider late submissions <strong>only</strong> for medical or family emergencies **where documentation can be provided**. This does not include overwhelming workload from other courses, scheduling conflicts, or vacation plans. The course policy of dropping two lowest homeworks and one quiz is in place to accommodate any unfortunate situation where no form of documentation can be provided.

* The lowest quiz score will be dropped. There will not be any make ups for quizzes.
* Two of the lowest homework scores will be dropped. Late homework submissions will not be accepted. However, even if you know you will not be able to submit a homework on time, I highly encourage you to complete it anyways since the homeworks will help prepare you for the quizzes and final exam.
* All labs must be submitted by the due date. Depending on the case, your TA may consider grading your lab with a late penalty (and usually for cases where the submission was done very soon after the deadline). However, this is not an official policy and you risk receiving a zero for a late lab submission. 

Accommodations for disabilities
-------------------------------

Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for exams online through the UCSB Disabled Students Program at [http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/](http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/). Please make your requests for exam accommodations through the online system as early in the quarter as possible to ensure proper arrangement.

Managing stress
---------------

Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, cultural differences, can interfere with the ability of students to succeed and thrive. For helpful resources, please contact UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) at 805-893-4411 or visit [http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/](http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/).

Responsible scholarship
-----------------------

Honesty and integrity in all academic work is essential for a valuable educational experience. The Office of Judicial Affairs has policies, tips, and resources for proper citation use, recognizing actions considered to be cheating or other forms of academic theft, and students’ responsibilities, available on their website at: https://studentconduct.sa.ucsb.edu/academic-integrity. **Students are responsible for educating themselves on the policies and abide by them.**

Furthermore, for general academic support, students are encouraged to visit Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) early and often. CLAS offers instructional groups, drop-in tutoring, writing and ESL services, skills workshops and one-on-one consultations. CLAS is located on the third floor of the Student Resource Building, or visit http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu
