''' Final Exam Logistics
* The final exam will be in-person (LSB 1001), Wed 12/8 @ 7:30 - 9:30pm PST
* Bring a writing utensil and photo ID
	* Please write LEGIBLY (if we can't read it, we can't grade it)
	* Preferrably ink / dark led
	* When leaving the room, you musts present your ID and hand in
	your exam before leaving (it's your ticket out!)
	* Closed book: (No notes / book / electronic devices)
* The final will be cumulative
* Questions
	* True / False (if false, explain why)
	* Short answer
		* Briefly explain / describe / define / state / ...
	* Given some code, write the output
	* Write code satisfying a certain specification (similar to quizzes)
	* Given some algorithm we covered, fill in the blank to make it work
	* Draw diagrams
* I plan to design the exam such that 2 hours should be enough time
asuming students prepare and study the material.
* TAs and I will be proctoring the exam and can help answer any CLARIFYING
questions

	* Inheritance
		* Know the implementation and inheritance of fields / methods
		and how to override inherited methods
		* Know the pattern on how to construct inherited classes

	O-notation for various functionality of data structures
		* Stacks, Queues, Deques, Linked Lists, and Ordered Linked Lists
* Sorting Algorithms
	* Know the implementation and O-notation analysis (best and worst
	case scenarios) of various sorting algorithms

	* Terminology
	* Know min-heap / max-heap data structure implementation (and the
	underlying list)
	* Binary Trees
		* Nodes / references implementation
